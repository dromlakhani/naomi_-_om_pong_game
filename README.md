### Creators:
- Naomi Lakhani (11 years old) - The Pong Prodigy üëß
- Dr. Om J Lakhani (40 years old) - The Coding Guru üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è

## The Story Behind the Game

Imagine a rainy Saturday afternoon. While most kids might be glued to their tablets, 11-year-old Naomi had a brilliant idea: "Dad, can we make our own video game?" And just like that, a coding adventure began!

Dr. Om, always eager to nurture his daughter's curiosity, saw this as a perfect opportunity to bond over bits and bytes. With his medical background, Om brought a unique perspective to the world of coding, proving that it's never too late to learn new skills!

## The Making of the Game

### Brainstorming Phase:
- Naomi: "Let's make something classic but cool!"
- Om: "How about Pong? It's simple yet fun!"
- Naomi: "Yes! But can we add our own twist?"

### The Twist:
They decided to make the game a reflection of themselves:
- Left paddle: Controlled by arrow keys, representing quick-thinking Naomi
- Right paddle: Controlled by mouse, representing the precise movements of surgeon Om

### The Coding Journey:
1. **HTML Canvas:** Om explained how this is like a digital drawing board.
2. **JavaScript Magic:** Naomi was fascinated by how a few lines of code could make things move!
3. **Game Logic:** They worked together to decide how scoring would work.
4. **Character Design:** Naomi insisted on adding cartoon versions of themselves.
5. **Winning Celebration:** Because every victory deserves confetti!

### Challenges Faced:
- Debugging became a fun puzzle-solving activity.
- Naomi learned that patience is key in coding (and in beating Dad at Pong!).
- Om discovered that explaining coding concepts to a kid makes you understand them better.

## Life Lessons Learned:

1. **Creativity Knows No Age:** An 11-year-old and a 40-year-old can create something awesome together.
2. **Coding is for Everyone:** Whether you're a student or a doctor, coding can be a fun skill to learn.
3. **Father-Daughter Bonding:** Who needs a typical game night when you can code your own game?
4. **Learning Never Stops:** Om realized that keeping up with his tech-savvy daughter meant continuous learning for him too.
5. **Persistence Pays Off:** From squashing bugs to perfecting the game, they learned that great things take time and effort.

## How to Play:

1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. Naomi (left player) uses the Up and Down arrow keys.
3. Om (right player) uses the mouse.
4. First to 7 points wins!
5. Enjoy the celebration (and maybe demand a rematch)!

## The Future:

Naomi and Om are already planning their next coding project. Will it be a space adventure? A puzzle game? Or perhaps a digital stethoscope? Stay tuned for more exciting projects from this dynamic duo!

Remember, whether you're 11 or 40, it's never too early or too late to start coding. Who knows? Your next family game night might just involve creating the game itself!

Happy Coding and Happy Playing! üéÆüë®‚Äçüëß
